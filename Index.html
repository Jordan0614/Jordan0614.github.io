<h1> Welcome to the Index! </h1>

<p> Hi! My name is Jordan Anderson-Murray and I am a senior Computer Science student
    at North Carolina A&T State University. I am originally from Richmond, VA, but
    I currently reside in Greensboro, NC. My favorite color is blue and I love chocolate!
    I enjoy reading, watching movies, and listening to music. </p>
